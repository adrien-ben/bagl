# bagl
baGL is an OpengGL framework that I use for educational purpose.

### Features
- Blinn-Phong deferred rendering
- Simple .obj and .mtl loaders
- Lights (ambient lights, directional lights, point lights and spot lights)
- Skyboxes
- 3D Particles using Geometry Shader
- Spritebatching
- Scalable text using Signed Distance Field fonts. See [Valve's paper](http://www.valvesoftware.com/publications/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf).
- Simple scene graph

## TODO
- Improving scene graph
    - Game Objects with components(Mesh, Light, ...)
- Rendering
    - Shadow mapping
    - Physically Based Rendering
    - Animations
    - Sprites in 3D environment (particles, debug icons, ...)
- 2D scene
- Assets managment
- OpenGL state manager
- And much more... :)
