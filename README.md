- Simple .obj and .mtl loaders
- Lights (ambient lights, directional lights, point lights and spot lights)
- Skyboxes
- Spritebatching
- Basic True Type fonts rendering
- Simple scene graph

## TODO
- Improving scene graph
    - Game Objects with components(Mesh, Light, ...)
- Rendering
    - Shadow mapping
    - Physically Based Rendering
    - Animations
    - Sprites in 3D environment (particles, debug icons, ...)
- 2D scene
- Assets managment
- OpenGL state manager
- And much more... :)
